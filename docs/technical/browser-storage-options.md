# Browser Storage Options for Prisoner's Dilemma

This document outlines various browser storage options available for our application, their limitations, and recommendations for implementation.

## Current Approach: localStorage

Our application currently uses the browser's localStorage API for data persistence with the following implementation:

- Player data storage via `PlayerStorageService`
- Connection management via `ConnectionService`
- Result pattern for error handling
- Immutable data patterns to prevent state mutations

While this approach has worked well for our MVP, it has certain limitations:

### localStorage Limitations

- **Size Constraints**: 2MB to 10MB per origin depending on the browser
- **String-Only Storage**: All data must be stored as strings (using JSON.stringify)
- **Synchronous API**: Blocks the main thread during operations
- **No Complex Queries**: Limited to simple key-value operations
- **No Built-in Indexing**: Makes searching through large datasets inefficient

## Alternative Storage Options

### IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a more powerful browser database system that offers several advantages:

- **Higher Storage Limits**: Generally 50-60% of available disk space
- **Asynchronous API**: Operations don't block the main thread
- **Object Storage**: Directly store JavaScript objects without serialization
- **Transactional**: Supports ACID transactions for data integrity
- **Indexable**: Create indices for efficient queries
- **Wide Browser Support**: Available in all modern browsers

**Best for**: Complex data relationships, larger datasets, and performance-critical applications

### Cache API (with Service Workers)

The Cache API allows for resource caching and offline capabilities:

- **Asset Storage**: Cache application resources (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Offline Support**: Enable functionality without network connectivity
- **PWA Integration**: Foundation for Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Asynchronous API**: Performance-friendly operations

**Best for**: Application resources, offline support, and PWA capabilities

### Origin Private File System (OPFS)

A newer sandboxed file system API offering:

- **File-Based Storage**: Efficient for larger data blobs
- **High Performance**: Better for data-intensive operations
- **Sandboxed Security**: Protected access within origin
- **No User Prompts**: Works without permission dialogs

**Best for**: Large data files, game state snapshots, and advanced data persistence

### sessionStorage

Similar to localStorage but with session-based persistence:

- **Session Duration**: Data persists only for the browser session
- **Same API**: Uses the same interface as localStorage
- **Same Limitations**: Has the same size and data type constraints

**Best for**: Temporary session data that shouldn't persist between visits

### File System Access API

Provides access to the device's file system:

- **User Files**: Read/write to user's file system
- **Permission Based**: Requires explicit user consent
- **Large Data Support**: No practical size limitations

**Best for**: Import/export functionality, backup systems, and user file interaction

## Recommendations for Our Application

For the Prisoner's Dilemma application, we recommend:

1. **Primary Storage**: Migrate to IndexedDB for game data and connection management
   - Higher storage limits for game history
   - Better performance for complex operations
   - Compatible with our existing Result pattern

2. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Create an abstraction layer that preserves our current service interfaces
   - Implement a data migration service for existing localStorage data
   - Maintain backwards compatibility for older browsers

3. **Supplementary Storage**:
   - Use Cache API for application assets and offline support
   - Implement File System Access API for game export/import features

4. **Enhanced Features Enabled by New Storage**:
   - Extended game history without storage concerns
   - More detailed statistics and analysis
   - Game replay functionality
   - User data backup and restoration

## Migration Path

To transition from localStorage to IndexedDB:

1. Create a generic storage interface that both implementations can satisfy
2. Implement the IndexedDB service while maintaining the localStorage service
3. Create a migration utility to transfer existing data
4. Add fallback logic for browsers that don't support IndexedDB
5. Update existing services to use the new storage layer

This approach allows us to gradually transition while maintaining compatibility with existing code and ensuring no data loss for current users.
