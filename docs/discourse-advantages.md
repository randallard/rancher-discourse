# Discourse on Rancher: Project Plan & Status

This document serves as a living record of our project plan, current status, and progress towards completing the Discourse deployment on Rancher Kubernetes.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Configuration & Customization  
**Last Updated**: May 12, 2025

## Project Vision

To deploy and configure a production-ready Discourse forum on our Rancher-managed Kubernetes cluster using the Bitnami Helm chart approach, providing a scalable and maintainable community platform.

## Deployment Approach

Our deployment will follow a structured approach with emphasis on documentation and testing:

1. **Research & Selection**: Evaluate deployment options and select optimal approach
2. **Environment Preparation**: Configure Rancher and Kubernetes prerequisites 
3. **Deployment Configuration**: Create and validate Helm chart values
4. **Testing Deployment**: Deploy in development environment and validate functionality
5. **Production Deployment**: Roll out to production with monitoring and backup strategies
6. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive deployment and operational documentation
7. **User Onboarding**: Create user guides and training materials

We've chosen to use the **Bitnami Helm Chart** approach as outlined in [our deployment options documentation]({{ '/docs/technical/deployment-options' | relative_url }}), specifically Option 1, for its balance of simplicity, maintainability, and customization capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate and resolve intermittent 503 errors
2. Set up regular backup schedule (high priority)
3. Configure email notification system (high priority)
4. Document operational procedures, including VPN requirements
5. Complete configuration of required plugins
6. Apply organization branding and theme
7. Create draft user tutorial content

## Current Focus: Troubleshooting 503 Errors & Email Configuration

With the development environment deployed and admin access configured, our current priorities are:

1. **503 Error Investigation**: Monitoring and troubleshooting intermittent 503 errors that occur when accessing specific Discourse topics
2. **Email System Setup**: Configuring and testing email functionality for notifications and password resets (high priority)
3. **Backup Configuration**: Setting up regular backup schedule for Discourse data (high priority)
4. **Operational Documentation**: Documenting VPN requirements and access procedures
5. **Plugin Configuration**: Setting up and testing the discourse-solved, discourse-voting, and discourse-data-explorer plugins
6. **Branding Implementation**: Applying organizational themes and customizations

We've successfully overcome initial deployment challenges with certificates, memory allocation, startup optimizations, and admin authentication issues, providing a solid foundation for further development and configuration.

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Successful Discourse Deployment**: Deployed Discourse using Bitnami Helm chart on Rancher West Kubernetes cluster with Longhorn storage
2. **Admin Access Resolution**: Diagnosed and resolved admin authentication issues related to VPN connectivity
3. **Deployment Documentation**: Created detailed documentation of deployment process and troubleshooting steps
4. **Configuration Optimization**: Optimized container startup by configuring appropriate probe timings and disabling asset precompilation

## Known Issues

1. **Intermittent 503 Errors**: Investigating sporadic 503 errors when accessing specific Discourse topics
2. **VPN Dependency**: Admin access requires VPN connectivity, which needs to be documented clearly
3. **Admin Account Creation**: Manual creation worked through kubectl - not with helm

## Technology Choices

### Infrastructure
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes managed by Rancher
- **Deployment Method**: Helm charts (Bitnami)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (included in Helm chart)
- **Cache**: Redis (included in Helm chart)
- **Ingress**: NGINX Ingress Controller
- **TLS**: Let's Encrypt with cert-manager
- **Storage**: Longhorn

### Discourse Configuration
- **Version**: Latest stable from Bitnami chart (3.4.3)
- **Plugins**: discourse-solved, discourse-voting, discourse-data-explorer
- **Theme**: Custom theme based on organization branding
- **Authentication**: Internal with SSO integration (if required)

### Operations
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack or Loki
- **Backups**: Automated using Velero
- **CI/CD**: GitOps with ArgoCD or FluxCD

## Open Questions

- What is causing the intermittent 503 errors and how can they be resolved?
- What specific metrics should we monitor for Discourse health?
- What backup schedule is appropriate for our usage patterns?
- How should we handle Discourse updates and database migrations?
- What additional plugins might be needed as usage grows?
- How will we measure user adoption and engagement?
- What user feedback mechanisms should we implement for the documentation?
