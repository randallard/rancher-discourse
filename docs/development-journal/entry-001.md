## Current Status

Project initialized with basic documentation structure using Just the Docs theme. Setting up project management and development workflows.

## Accomplishments

- Created GitHub repository for project documentation
- Set up Just the Docs theme with custom configuration
- Established directory structure for documentation
- Created development journal template and index
- Added latest journal entry display to homepage

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Documentation Organization

**Description:** Needed to determine the most effective way to organize documentation that would accommodate both development logs and user/technical guides.

**Resolution:** Adopted a hierarchical structure with clear separation between development journal, technical documentation, user guides, and game theory resources. Used Just the Docs' parent/child page capabilities to create intuitive navigation.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Documentation-First Approach

**Context:** Needed to decide whether to focus on code first or documentation first.

**Options Considered:**
- Start with code development, document later
- Begin with comprehensive documentation planning
- Use a documentation-driven development approach

**Decision:** Adopted a documentation-driven development approach where we outline requirements, architecture, and plans before significant coding begins.

**Rationale:** This approach will help clarify requirements, establish shared understanding among team members, and create a roadmap for development. It also provides immediate value through documentation even before code is complete.

### Decision 2: Journal Entry Format

**Context:** Needed a consistent format for tracking development progress.

**Options Considered:**
- Simple date-based changelog
- Detailed structured journal entries
- Wiki-style documentation

**Decision:** Created a structured journal template with sections for status, accomplishments, challenges, decisions, and next actions.

**Rationale:** This format provides more context than a simple changelog while maintaining readability and consistency. The structured approach helps ensure important details aren't overlooked.

## Next Actions

1. Set up development environment and technologies (React, Node.js) - High Priority
2. Design database schema for game data - Medium Priority
3. Create initial wireframes for user interface - Medium Priority
4. Define core game mechanics and rules implementation - High Priority
