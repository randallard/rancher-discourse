## Current Status

Core implementation phase begun. Successfully setup testing infrastructure and created first failing tests for the Player Registration component following our TDD approach.

## Accomplishments

- Fixed npm script configuration in package.json
- Successfully ran test suite for initial player registration component
- Verified development environment is functioning correctly
- Established first TDD cycle with failing tests (Red phase)

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Script Execution Issues

**Resolution:** 
Properly configured npm scripts in package.json to support our dual testing strategy, enabling both unit and component tests to run correctly.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Test-First Implementation for Player Registration

**Context:** 
Needed to determine the best approach to start implementing core functionality.

**Decision:** 
Started with writing failing tests for player registration component to establish TDD workflow.

**Rationale:** 
This approach ensures we have clear requirements for the component from the beginning and establishes our TDD workflow for the project. The player registration component is fundamental to the application, making it the logical starting point.

## Next Actions

1. Complete Player Registration implementation to pass failing tests (Green phase)
2. Refactor Player Registration component for better design
3. Implement local storage functionality with comprehensive tests
4. Begin connection mechanism implementation
