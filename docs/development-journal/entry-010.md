## Current Status

Successfully implemented and tested the Player Storage Service and integrated it with the Game App component. All tests are now passing after resolving component lifecycle and testing issues in the Game App component.

## Accomplishments

- Implemented PlayerStorageService for persistent player data storage using localStorage
- Created comprehensive unit tests for PlayerStorageService functionality
- Integrated PlayerStorageService with the GameApp component
- Fixed component lifecycle testing issues in GameApp tests
- Implemented test helper methods to facilitate proper component testing
- Established patterns for mocking services in component tests
- Fixed test timeout issues with proper component state management

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Component Lifecycle Management in Tests

**Description:** Tests for the GameApp component were timing out because changing mock service data didn't automatically update the component's internal state. The component's player data was loaded in `connectedCallback()` which had already run during fixture creation, before modifying the mock service.

**Resolution:** 
- Added a dedicated test helper method `setPlayerForTesting()` to the GameApp component
- Used this method to directly update the component's state in tests
- Ensured proper wait patterns with `await element.updateComplete` to handle LitElement's rendering cycle
- Fixed type visibility issues by making the test helper method explicitly public

### Challenge 2: Mocking Service Dependencies

**Description:** Testing the GameApp component required isolating it from the actual localStorage implementation, which is difficult to control in tests and can lead to test pollution between test cases.

**Resolution:**
- Created a dedicated MockPlayerStorageService that extends PlayerStorageService
- Overrode critical methods with controlled test implementations
- Added mock state properties to track changes in the mock service
- Implemented a reset mechanism to ensure test isolation between cases
- Used dependency injection pattern to replace the service in tests

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Add Testing-Specific Methods to Components

**Context:** Needed to decide how to handle updating private component state in tests without compromising encapsulation in production code.

**Options Considered:**
- Cast to `any` type to bypass TypeScript visibility checks
- Make internal state protected instead of private
- Add explicit public methods specifically for testing purposes

**Decision:** Added a dedicated public method `setPlayerForTesting()` to explicitly set component state for tests.

**Rationale:**
- Maintains proper encapsulation of internal state in production code
- Makes testing intention clear in component code
- Follows best practices for testable components
- Satisfies TypeScript's visibility rules while enabling proper testing
- Creates a clear API for test-only operations

### Decision 2: Use Class Extension for Service Mocking

**Context:** Needed to decide how to properly mock the PlayerStorageService in component tests.

**Options Considered:**
- Create a completely separate mock object with the same interface
- Use Jest-style mocking with jest.fn() replacements
- Extend the original service class and override methods
- Use a mock implementation of the localStorage API

**Decision:** Created a MockPlayerStorageService class that extends PlayerStorageService.

**Rationale:**
- Ensures type compatibility with the original service
- Allows selective override of specific methods while keeping others
- Provides clear structure for mock state tracking
- Creates consistent patterns for service mocking across tests
- Simplifies test setup and makes intentions clear

## Next Actions

1. Complete the Refactor phase for the GameApp component
2. Implement game interface design with proper styling
3. Begin connection mechanism implementation
4. Add player settings management
5. Create game interaction components following the same TDD approach
6. Update documentation with current service patterns and testing strategies
