## Current Status

Environment setup phase. Transitioning from initial Open WC scaffolding to a more integrated approach using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and dual testing frameworks.

## Accomplishments

- Integrated Tailwind CSS v4.0 with Vite using the new first-party plugin
- Established a comprehensive testing strategy with dual frameworks
- Set up TypeScript support throughout the development and testing pipeline
- Created initial component templates following TDD principles
- Configured build process with type checking enforcement

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Tailwind CSS Integration Issues

The initial attempt to configure Tailwind CSS with Open WC proved problematic, with various CSS processing issues that made the integration unreliable.

**Resolution:**
We moved to Tailwind CSS v4.0's new first-party Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`), which provides streamlined integration with significantly less configuration. This also allows us to use Tailwind's simplified syntax with just a single `@import "tailwindcss"` directive.

### Challenge 2: Choosing the Right Testing Approach

We faced the challenge of selecting between competing testing frameworks - Vitest (the Vite-native solution) and @web/test-runner (from Open WC). Each had distinct advantages:

- Vitest: Seamless Vite integration, faster execution, Jest-like API
- @web/test-runner: Browser-based testing environment, better for component tests

**Resolution:**
Rather than selecting one over the other, we've implemented a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both frameworks:
- Vitest for unit testing of pure logic functions
- @web/test-runner for component testing with real browser behavior

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Adopting Vite for Build Process

**Context:**
While initially using Open WC scaffolding, we encountered limitations in the CSS processing pipeline, particularly for Tailwind integration.

**Options Considered:**
- Continue with Open WC's build process and work around CSS limitations
- Migrate to Vite while preserving Open WC testing capabilities
- Complete rebuild with only Vite and Vitest

**Decision:**
Migrate to Vite as the primary build tool while preserving Open WC testing utilities for component testing.

**Rationale:**
- Vite's development server offers superior HMR and faster builds
- Tailwind CSS v4.0 provides first-party Vite integration
- Preserving Open WC testing provides better browser-based component testing
- This approach minimizes configuration while maximizing developer experience

### Decision 2: Implementing a Dual Testing Strategy

**Context:**
Different testing needs require different environments - quick unit tests vs. accurate browser component tests.

**Options Considered:**
- Use only Vitest for all testing needs
- Use only @web/test-runner for all testing needs
- Implement a dual approach with both frameworks

**Decision:**
Adopt a dual testing strategy with both Vitest and @web/test-runner.

**Rationale:**
- Unit tests run faster with Vitest's Node-based environment
- Component tests are more accurate with @web/test-runner's browser environment
- The hybrid approach allows for the best development experience without sacrifices
- Both frameworks can use the same core assertions and helpers
- TypeScript support works well with both frameworks

### Decision 3: Enforcing Strong TypeScript Integration

**Context:**
The project was initially scaffolded with TypeScript, and we wanted to ensure type safety throughout the build and test process.

**Options Considered:**
- Relaxed TypeScript configuration
- Strict TypeScript enforcement
- Moving away from TypeScript

**Decision:**
Maintain strict TypeScript configuration throughout the project, including tests.

**Rationale:**
- Prevents type-related bugs earlier in the development cycle
- Improves developer experience with better IDE integration
- Provides better documentation through type definitions
- Enables safer refactoring and maintenance
- Aligns with the best practices in web component development

## Next Actions

1. Implement player registration component following TDD (High priority)
2. Set up local storage functionality with tests (High priority)
3. Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing (Medium priority)
4. Create connection mechanism between players (Medium priority)
5. Implement basic game screen (Medium priority)
