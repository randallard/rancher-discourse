## Current Status

Unit tests with Vitest are now working properly. Successfully resolved configuration issues in the project that were preventing tests from running correctly.

## Accomplishments

- Fixed Vitest configuration by correcting dependency paths
- Successfully ran Vitest unit tests for the game logic module
- Updated TypeScript configuration to support modern ES modules
- Identified conflicts between testing frameworks

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Vitest Configuration Path Issues

**Description:** Encountered errors with Vitest configuration being loaded from the wrong path. The error indicated that Vitest was looking for its config file in the parent directory rather than the application directory.

**Resolution:** Updated the Vitest configuration to use the proper Vite imports instead of Vitest-specific imports, which resolved the path resolution issues. Changed:
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
```
to:
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
```

### Challenge 2: Module Resolution in TypeScript

**Description:** TypeScript was unable to properly resolve the `@tailwindcss/vite` module, preventing compilation and causing errors with modern `.mts` file extensions.

**Resolution:** Modified the `moduleResolution` setting in both the main `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` files to use the "bundler" option, which provides better support for ES modules and modern file extensions.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: TypeScript Module Resolution Update

**Context:** Needed to decide how to handle modern module formats in TypeScript.

**Options Considered:**
- Keep current Node.js resolution (`"moduleResolution": "node"`)
- Update to bundler-oriented resolution (`"moduleResolution": "bundler"`)

**Decision:** Updated to `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` for TypeScript configurations.

**Rationale:** The "bundler" option is specifically designed for Vite and other modern bundlers, providing better support for ESM module formats and `.mts` extensions. This approach aligns with current best practices for Vite-based projects.

## Next Actions

1. Complete resolution of Web Test Runner issues for component tests (High priority)
2. Implement Player Registration component to pass unit tests (High priority)
3. Configure Tailwind CSS styling for components (Medium priority)
4. Enhance game logic implementation (Medium priority)
