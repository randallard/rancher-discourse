## Current Status

Successfully resolved the component testing framework conflicts between Vitest and web-test-runner. The dual testing strategy is now functioning as designed, with component tests now failing appropriately (Red phase of TDD) due to the component not being implemented yet.

## Accomplishments

- Eliminated conflicts between Vitest and web-test-runner environments
- Removed unnecessary imports from component test files
- Verified web-test-runner is correctly handling component tests
- Confirmed tests are failing for the expected reasons (component implementation pending)
- Maintained commitment to our dual testing strategy as outlined in the project plan

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Testing Framework Import Conflicts

**Description:** Component tests were failing to run due to conflicts between Vitest imports and the web-test-runner environment. The error message indicated that Vitest was being imported directly without running the Vitest command, causing state access issues.

**Resolution:** Removed Vitest-specific imports (`import { describe, it } from 'vitest'`) from component test files, relying instead on the globals provided by web-test-runner's Mocha environment. This eliminated the framework conflict while preserving our dual testing approach.

### Challenge 2: Node Module Resolution in Browser Environment

**Description:** Attempted to resolve the missing globals by importing from Node's test module (`import { describe, it } from 'node:test'`), which generated browser compatibility errors since node modules cannot be accessed in the browser environment.

**Resolution:** Recognized that the web-test-runner environment already provides the necessary test functions globally, eliminating the need for any imports. This approach properly separates our testing environments while maintaining the desired functionality.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Maintain Dual Testing Strategy

**Context:** After encountering configuration challenges, needed to decide whether to continue with our dual testing approach or simplify to a single framework.

**Options Considered:**
- Simplify to use only Vitest for all testing
- Simplify to use only web-test-runner for all testing
- Maintain dual approach but with clearer separation

**Decision:** Maintained our dual testing strategy with clearer separation between the environments.

**Rationale:** 
- The benefits of specialized testing environments (Vitest for unit tests, web-test-runner for component tests) outweigh the configuration complexity
- Proper separation of imports resolves the conflicts without sacrificing functionality
- This approach aligns with our project plan and maximizes testing quality and developer experience
- Initial complexity is worth the long-term benefits of having the right tools for each testing need

### Decision 2: Framework-Specific File Conventions

**Context:** Needed to establish clear conventions for separating test files to avoid future framework conflicts.

**Decision:** Component test files will avoid importing test framework globals, relying on web-test-runner's globals. Unit test files will explicitly import from Vitest.

**Rationale:**
- Creates clear separation between testing environments
- Prevents future conflicts between frameworks
- Simplifies development by establishing clear patterns
- Aligns with framework best practices

## Next Actions

1. Implement the PlayerForm component to pass the existing tests (Green phase)
2. Complete the refactoring phase for the PlayerForm component
3. Implement local storage functionality with appropriate tests
4. Begin connection mechanism implementation
5. Document our testing approach for team reference
