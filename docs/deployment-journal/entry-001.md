## Current Status

Project initialized with basic documentation structure using Just the Docs theme. Setting up project management and preparing for Discourse deployment on Rancher Kubernetes using the Bitnami Helm chart approach.



Deliberated extensively with Claude

1. [Discussion Forum Software](https://claude.ai/share/bd8a7cd1-fa42-4236-b42e-d4a11eb719fc)
2. [Deploying Discourse on Rancher](https://claude.ai/share/b8503f07-a2a6-499f-9449-95e15427f6cf)

## Accomplishments

- Created GitHub repository for project documentation
- Set up Just the Docs theme with custom configuration
- Established directory structure for documentation
- Created Deployment journal template and index
- Added latest journal entry display to homepage
- Documented deployment options for Discourse on Rancher
- Selected Bitnami Helm chart approach (Option 1) for our deployment

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Documentation Organization

**Description:** Needed to determine the most effective way to organize documentation that would accommodate both deployment logs and technical guides for Discourse on Rancher.

**Resolution:** Adopted a hierarchical structure with clear separation between deployment journal, technical documentation, user guides, and operational resources. Used Just the Docs' parent/child page capabilities to create intuitive navigation.

### Challenge 2: Deployment Method Selection

**Description:** Needed to evaluate different approaches for deploying Discourse on Rancher Kubernetes.

**Resolution:** Researched three potential deployment methods (Bitnami Helm chart, custom image with manual deployment, and community resources). Selected the Bitnami Helm chart approach for its maintainability, comprehensive configuration options, and simplified deployment process.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Documentation-First Approach

**Context:** Needed to decide whether to focus on code first or documentation first.

**Options Considered:**
- Start with deployment immediately, document later
- Begin with comprehensive documentation planning
- Use a documentation-driven deployment approach

**Decision:** Adopted a documentation-driven deployment approach where we outline requirements, architecture, and deployment options before beginning the implementation.

**Rationale:** This approach will help clarify requirements, establish shared understanding among team members, and create a roadmap for deployment. It also provides immediate value through documentation even before deployment is complete.

### Decision 2: Deployment Strategy Selection

**Context:** Needed to select the most appropriate method for deploying Discourse on Rancher.

**Options Considered:**
- Using Bitnami's Helm chart
- Building a custom Discourse image and deploying it manually 
- Using community-contributed Kubernetes configuration files

**Decision:** Selected Option 1: Using Bitnami's Helm chart for deployment.

**Rationale:** The Bitnami Helm chart provides a maintained, production-ready solution that simplifies deployment while still allowing for sufficient customization. This approach reduces maintenance overhead and leverages community-supported resources.

## Next Actions

1. Create a values.yaml file tailored to our Rancher environment - High Priority
2. Set up a test Kubernetes namespace in our Rancher cluster - High Priority
3. Configure storage class and persistent volume claims - Medium Priority
4. Test Helm chart deployment in development environment - High Priority
5. Document initial configuration steps for post-deployment - Medium Priority
