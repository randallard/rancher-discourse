## Troubleshooting

I addressed authentication issues with the Discourse admin account following the initial deployment. The investigation revealed that VPN connectivity was a contributing factor. By examining pod and container statuses, analyzing logs, and verifying network requirements, I successfully resolved the issue and ensured proper admin access.

## Observations

During the troubleshooting process, I observed that Discourse authentication is network-sensitive, requiring proper VPN connectivity for internal access. Additionally, the misleading 200 OK response during failed login attempts highlighted the need for more detailed error handling in the application.

## Challenges

### Authentication Issues

**Description:** Admin authentication attempts were unsuccessful despite correct credentials.

**Resolution:** I connected to the required VPN, used cached browser connections, and verified admin functionality through the dashboard.

### Rails Console Access

**Description:** Direct access to the Rails console for database examination was hindered by environment configuration issues.

**Resolution:** I identified alternative methods to verify admin credentials and functionality without relying on the Rails console.

## Verification

To confirm the resolution, I performed the following steps:

1. Connected to the required VPN.
2. Accessed the Discourse instance via the configured URL.
3. Successfully logged in with administrative credentials.
4. Verified admin functionality by accessing the admin dashboard.

## Decisions

### VPN Requirement Documentation

**Context:** Authentication requires proper VPN connectivity for internal network access.

**Decision:** I documented the VPN requirement in access instructions to prevent future confusion.

### Asset Precompilation Setting

**Context:** The deployment uses `DISCOURSE_PRECOMPILE_ASSETS: "no"` to speed up container startup.

**Decision:** I maintained the current setting, as it does not affect core functionality after initial setup.

## Next Steps

1. Document the VPN requirement in access instructions.
2. Configure the email notification system.
3. Create instructions for the password reset procedure.
4. Implement an admin user creation script for future deployments.
5. Test SMTP configuration to ensure password reset emails work properly.
6. Review container memory limits to prevent future OOMKilled events.
