## Current Status

Successfully resolved authentication issues with the Discourse admin account after initial deployment. Identified VPN connectivity as a contributing factor and verified proper admin access.

## Accomplishments

- Diagnosed admin authentication issues on Discourse instance
- Examined pod and container status to verify deployment health
- Investigated login attempts through container logs
- Resolved VPN connectivity requirement for proper authentication
- Verified admin user functionality

## Troubleshooting Process

The troubleshooting process involved examining the deployment configuration and logs to identify authentication issues:

### Step 1: Verify Pod Status

First, we checked the status of all pods in the discourse-dev namespace to ensure they were running properly:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\ryankhetlyr\.kube\rancher-e.yaml
```

Output confirmed all pods were running:
```
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
discourse-7657c786c6-jgbzk   2/2     Running   2 (2d9h ago)   2d14h
discourse-postgresql-0       1/1     Running   0              2d14h
discourse-redis-master-0     1/1     Running   0              2d14h
```

### Step 2: Examine Pod Details

Next, we examined the detailed status of the discourse pod:

```bash
kubectl describe pod discourse-7657c786c6-jgbzk -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\ryankhetlyr\.kube\rancher-e.yaml
```

This showed that:
- The pod was running properly
- The discourse and sidekiq containers were active
- Resource limits were configured as expected
- The sidekiq container had experienced an OOMKilled restart previously
- Environment variables were properly set from secrets

### Step 3: Check Container Logs

We examined the logs from the discourse container to identify any authentication-related issues:

```bash
kubectl logs discourse-7657c786c6-jgbzk -c discourse -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\ryankhetlyr\.kube\rancher-e.yaml
```

Login attempt logs were found:
```
Started POST "/session" for 10.222.183.236 at 2025-05-12 11:45:05 +0000
Processing by SessionController#create as */*
  Parameters: {"login"=>"software_solutions@waed.uscourts.gov", "password"=>"[FILTERED]", "second_factor_method"=>"1", "timezone"=>"America/Los_Angeles"}
Completed 200 OK in 13ms (Views: 0.1ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms (0 queries, 0 cached) | GC: 6.9ms)
```

The 200 OK response suggested the request was processed successfully but authentication was not working as expected.

### Step 4: Attempt to Access Rails Console

We attempted to access the Rails console to directly examine the database:

```bash
kubectl exec -it discourse-7657c786c6-jgbzk -c discourse -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\ryankhetlyr\.kube\rancher-e.yaml -- bash -c "cd /opt/bitnami/discourse && bundle exec rails c"
```

This revealed issues with the Rails environment configuration and binstubs that prevented direct console access.

### Step 5: Root Cause Identification

We determined two key issues:
1. VPN connectivity was required to properly authenticate but was not active during initial login attempts
2. The asset precompilation setting (`DISCOURSE_PRECOMPILE_ASSETS: "no"`) might have been affecting the proper initialization of the application

### Step 6: Resolution

1. Connected to the required VPN to ensure proper network routing
2. Used existing cached browser connection to access the Discourse instance
3. Successfully authenticated using the admin credentials defined in values.yaml

## Verification Steps

The following steps were used to verify the resolution:

1. Connected to the required VPN
2. Accessed the Discourse instance via the configured URL (discourse-dev.fcsf.dcn)
3. Successfully logged in with administrative credentials
4. Verified admin functionality by accessing admin dashboard

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Maintain VPN Requirement Documentation

**Context:** Authentication requires proper VPN connectivity for internal network access.

**Decision:** Document VPN requirement clearly in access instructions to prevent future confusion.

**Rationale:** Ensuring users are aware of the network requirements will prevent similar authentication issues in the future.

### Decision 2: Maintain Asset Precompilation Setting

**Context:** The deployment uses `DISCOURSE_PRECOMPILE_ASSETS: "no"` to speed up container startup.

**Options Considered:**
- Enable asset precompilation to ensure full initialization
- Maintain current setting for faster startup

**Decision:** Maintain the current setting as it does not affect core functionality after initial setup.

**Rationale:** The authentication issues were related to network connectivity rather than asset precompilation, and the current setting provides performance benefits.

## Observations

1. Discourse authentication appears to be network-sensitive and requires proper routing through VPN
2. The 200 OK response during failed authentication attempts was misleading
3. The Rails console access issues prevent some direct database troubleshooting methods
4. The Bitnami Discourse container has specific environment requirements that affect troubleshooting approaches

## Next Actions

1. Document VPN requirement in access instructions - High Priority
2. Configure email notifications system - High Priority (carried forward)
3. Create instructions for password reset procedure - Medium Priority
4. Implement admin user creation script for future deployments - Medium Priority
5. Test SMTP configuration to ensure password reset emails work properly - Medium Priority
6. Review container memory limits to prevent future OOMKilled events - Low Priority

## Commands To Use

```bash
# Check authentication logs
kubectl logs discourse-7657c786c6-jgbzk -c discourse -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\ryankhetlyr\.kube\rancher-e.yaml | grep -i session

# Force admin user creation (if needed in future)
kubectl exec -it discourse-7657c786c6-jgbzk -c discourse -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\ryankhetlyr\.kube\rancher-e.yaml -- bash -c "cd /opt/bitnami/discourse && RAILS_ENV=production bin/rake admin:create"

# Check SMTP configuration
kubectl exec -it discourse-7657c786c6-jgbzk -c discourse -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\ryankhetlyr\.kube\rancher-e.yaml -- bash -c "cd /opt/bitnami/discourse && RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails runner 'pp SiteSetting.notification_email'"

# Restart discourse (if needed)
kubectl rollout restart deployment discourse -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\ryankhetlyr\.kube\rancher-e.yaml
```
