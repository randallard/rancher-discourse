## Current Status

Investigating intermittent 503 errors on the Discourse deployment that was previously stable. The errors occur sporadically when browsing certain topics and then seem to resolve themselves without intervention.

## Issue Description

- Intermittent 503 errors when accessing specific Discourse topics
- Error first appeared when browsing to `discourse-dev.fcsf.dcn/t/admin-guide-getting-started/6`
- Browser displayed a "try again" button that was unsuccessful on multiple attempts
- Error eventually resolved itself without intervention
- Previously working URL `discourse-dev.fcsf.dcn/t/faq-guidelines/4/2` loaded normally

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Identify Pattern of 503 Errors

**Description:** Tracked when and where 503 errors appeared in the application.

**Findings:** 
- Errors seem to be specific to certain topic pages
- Error conditions appear temporary and self-resolving
- No apparent pattern to which pages trigger the error

### Step 2: Check Pod Status and Logs

**Description:** Initiated investigation of Kubernetes pod logs and status to identify potential causes.

**Next actions:**
- Retrieve and analyze pod logs during error periods
- Check for resource constraints or throttling
- Examine any error patterns or warnings in logs

### Step 3: Monitor Resource Usage

**Description:** Plan to monitor resource utilization during error occurrences.

**Next actions:**
- Check CPU, memory, and storage metrics
- Verify if resource limits are being reached
- Analyze if the application is being restarted due to resource pressure

## Potential Causes

1. **Resource Constraints:** The application may be hitting memory or CPU limits, causing temporary unavailability.
2. **Database Connection Issues:** Intermittent connection problems between Discourse and PostgreSQL.
3. **Background Job Processing:** Heavy background processing causing application unresponsiveness.
4. **Readiness/Liveness Probe Configuration:** Probes might be causing unnecessary restarts.
5. **Network or Ingress Issues:** Temporary network glitches affecting connectivity.

## Next Actions

1. Monitor pod logs during error periods - High Priority
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n discourse-dev <discourse-pod-name> --tail=100 --kubeconfig C:\Users\myuser\.kube\rancher-e.yaml
   ```

2. Check resource utilization metrics - High Priority
   ```bash
   kubectl top pods -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\myuser\.kube\rancher-e.yaml
   ```

3. Review pod events for restart or throttling indications - Medium Priority
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <discourse-pod-name> -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\myuser\.kube\rancher-e.yaml
   ```

4. Check if pods are being restarted - Medium Priority
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\myuser\.kube\rancher-e.yaml -w
   ```

5. Examine ingress configuration for potential issues - Medium Priority
   ```bash
   kubectl describe ingress discourse -n discourse-dev --kubeconfig C:\Users\myuser\.kube\rancher-e.yaml
   ```

6. Consider increasing resource limits if resource constraints are identified - Low Priority

## Potential Solutions

1. **Increase Resource Allocations:** If resource limits are causing issues, consider updating the values.yaml file:
   ```yaml
   discourse:
     resources:
       limits:
         memory: "2Gi"
         cpu: "1"
       requests:
         memory: "1Gi"
         cpu: "500m"
   ```

2. **Adjust Probe Configurations:** Further tune the readiness and liveness probe settings:
   ```yaml
   discourse:
     livenessProbe:
       failureThreshold: 6
     readinessProbe:
       failureThreshold: 6
   ```

3. **Enable Detailed Logging:** Configure more verbose logging to catch transient issues:
   ```yaml
   discourse:
     extraEnvVars:
       - name: DISCOURSE_LOG_LEVEL
         value: "debug"
   ```

4. **Check Database Connection Pool:** Review and potentially increase PostgreSQL connection pool settings.
