## Progress Update

Resolved several critical issues with the Discourse deployment including logo display problems and two-factor authentication configuration. Made significant progress on system stability and user authentication workflows.

## Issues Resolved

### Logo Display Problem

**Problem:** Logo images were not displaying correctly across different themes.

**Solution:** Fixed by forcing HTTPS protocol and re-uploading all logo images through the admin interface. This resolved display issues in both light and dark modes.

**Status:** âœ… Completed - Logo now displays correctly across all themes.

### Two-Factor Authentication with Duo Mobile

**Problem:** Two-factor authentication needed to be configured and verified.

**Solution:** Successfully set up Duo Mobile integration:
- Added authenticator using QR code scan
- Verified full authentication workflow
- Tested logout/login cycle with passcode verification
- Confirmed 2FA is working properly for enhanced security

**Status:** âœ… Completed - 2FA fully functional and tested.

## System Updates

### Discourse Version Upgrade

Successfully updated Discourse to version 3.4.4 through Argo deployment pipeline. The upgrade process was smooth with no service disruption.

**Status:** âœ… Completed - Running Discourse 3.4.4

## Outstanding Issues

### Passkey Login Configuration

**Description:** WebAuthn/Passkey authentication still requires configuration and testing.

**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress - Continuing work on passkey implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Complete passkey login configuration and testing
2. Perform comprehensive security audit of all authentication methods
3. Document final authentication setup procedures
4. Conduct user acceptance testing

## Technical Notes

- HTTPS enforcement was key to resolving logo display issues
- Duo Mobile integration provides robust 2FA security layer
- Argo deployment pipeline continues to work reliably for updates
- System performance remains stable after version upgrade
