## Progress Update

We've made significant progress on the Discourse deployment, though documentation has fallen behind our implementation pace. The core system is now functional and we've entered the verification stage where remaining issues need to be identified and resolved.

## Current Status

The Discourse instance is operational with most features working as expected. However, several authentication and UI elements require attention before we can consider the deployment complete.

## Outstanding Issues

### Passkey Login Configuration

**Description:** Passkey authentication needs to be properly configured and tested.

**Status:** Requires setup and verification of WebAuthn settings.

### Dark Mode Logo Display

**Description:** The logo is not displaying correctly in dark mode theme.

**Status:** Needs investigation of CSS styling and asset configuration.

## Next Steps

1. Enlist additional help for verification and troubleshooting remaining issues.
2. Configure and test passkey login functionality.
3. Investigate and fix dark mode logo display problem.
4. Conduct comprehensive testing of all authentication methods.
5. Update documentation to reflect current deployment state.

## Help Needed

Looking for assistance with final verification steps and resolving the authentication and theming issues. The deployment is close to completion but could benefit from fresh eyes on these specific problems.
