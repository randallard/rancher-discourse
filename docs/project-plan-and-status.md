# Prisoner's Dilemma App: Project Plan & Status

This document serves as a living record of our project plan, current status, and progress towards completing the Prisoner's Dilemma application.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Core Implementation (Connection UI Component Design)  
**Last Updated**: May 7, 2025

## Project Vision

To create an interactive application that allows friends to play the Prisoner's Dilemma game, learn about game theory, and analyze strategies and outcomes.

## Development Approach

This project follows **Test Driven Development (TDD)** principles with a **Red-Green-Refactor** workflow:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code quality while maintaining passing tests

We've established a **hybrid testing strategy** with:
- **Vitest**: For fast unit testing of logic functions
- **@web/test-runner**: For browser-based component testing

We will commit to making the smallest possible code changes with each iteration, ensuring:
- Every feature is thoroughly tested before implementation
- Code remains clean, maintainable, and follows best practices
- Technical debt is minimized through continuous refactoring
- Development progress is measurable through test coverage

## User Stories

We've created a comprehensive set of [user stories](/prisoners-dilemma-docs/docs/technical/user-stories) to guide our development process. Key user stories include:

- Player registration and local storage functionality
- Connection management between players
- Game initiation and statistics tracking

These user stories are prioritized to ensure we focus on the most important features first. See the full [user stories document](/prisoners-dilemma-docs/docs/technical/user-stories) for details.

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Apply immutable patterns to the PlayerStorageService
2. Design connection UI components with immutability and error type handling
3. Create UI utility helpers for immutable state management
4. Implement connection UI components using the Result pattern and immutable data
5. Integrate connection management with game app
6. Begin implementing game mechanics

## Current Focus: Connection UI Components Design with Immutable State

With both the ConnectionService and PlayerStorageService successfully refactored to use immutable patterns, we're now ready to begin designing and implementing the connection UI components. We've established a solid foundation with:

- Type-safe error handling using the Result pattern
- Immutable data patterns for predictable state management
- Comprehensive testing for all core functionality
- Clear separation of concerns between services and UI components

Our next focus will be designing and implementing connection UI components that utilize both the Result pattern and immutable state management from the start:

1. Connection Creation Component:
   - Generate shareable links with proper error handling
   - Display specific UI for each potential error type
   - Use immutable state updates for UI transitions
   - Provide clear success indicators for link generation

2. Connection List Component:
   - Display all connections with status indicators
   - Handle empty states and error conditions gracefully
   - Implement immutable list operations for updates
   - Include visual distinction between different connection states

3. Connection Detail Component:
   - Show detailed information about a specific connection
   - Provide status-specific actions (accept, delete, etc.)
   - Use immutable state transitions for UI updates
   - Include proper error handling for all operations

4. Connection Request Component:
   - Allow accepting or rejecting incoming connection requests
   - Display appropriate messaging based on request status
   - Handle validation and error cases with specific UI
   - Implement immutable state updates for request handling

Each component will be developed using our TDD approach with immutability in mind:
1. Design components with error state handling and immutable updates
2. Create failing tests for each component (Red phase)
3. Implement components using immutable patterns (Green phase)
4. Refactor for optimization and code quality (Refactor phase)

## Technology Choices

### Build System
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS v4.0 with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Build Scripts**: CommonJS (.cjs) for build-time utilities

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest (for pure logic functions)
- **Component Testing**: @web/test-runner (for browser-based component testing)
- **Test Helpers**: @open-wc/testing for component fixtures and assertions
- **Text Content Testing**: Use `.trim()` for consistent assertions
- **Service Mocking**: Result-based mocks replacing direct values
- **Component State Testing**: Dedicated public test helper methods

### Frontend Technologies
- **Web Components**: Lit with Shadow DOM
- **Best Practices**: Open WC principles (adapted for Vite)

- **Error Handling**: Result pattern for type-safe error handling
- **State Management**: Immutable data patterns to prevent mutation
- **Result Utilities**: Dedicated ResultUtils library for common operations

### API Selection
We will use the **friends-connect** API for handling player connections. This is a Rust library specifically designed for connecting players in game applications.

**Description**: A Rust library for connecting with friends to play games, providing the server-side functionality we need for managing connection requests and active connections.

## Open Questions

- What is our target test coverage percentage?
- How will we handle cross-browser compatibility testing?
- Should we automate accessibility testing?
- How will we handle edge cases like connection failures?
- Should we create a centralized error reporting service?
- What metrics should we collect about error frequency and types?
- How do we best balance immutability with performance for complex data structures?
