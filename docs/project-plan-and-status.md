# Discourse on Rancher: Project Plan & Status

This document serves as a living record of our project plan, current status, and progress towards completing the Discourse deployment on Rancher Kubernetes.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Production Deployment Complete - User Feedback & Enhancement Planning  
**Last Updated**: June 4, 2025

## Project Vision

To deploy and configure a production-ready Discourse forum on our Rancher-managed Kubernetes cluster using the Bitnami Helm chart approach, providing a scalable and maintainable community platform.

## Deployment Approach

Our deployment will follow a structured approach with emphasis on documentation and testing:

1. **Research & Selection**: Evaluate deployment options and select optimal approach
2. **Environment Preparation**: Configure Rancher and Kubernetes prerequisites 
3. **Deployment Configuration**: Create and validate Helm chart values
4. **Testing Deployment**: Deploy in development environment and validate functionality
5. **Production Deployment**: Roll out to production with monitoring and backup strategies
6. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive deployment and operational documentation
7. **User Onboarding**: Create user guides and training materials

We've chosen to use the **Bitnami Helm Chart** approach as outlined in [our deployment options documentation]({{ '/docs/technical/deployment-options' | relative_url }}), specifically Option 1, for its balance of simplicity, maintainability, and customization capabilities.
